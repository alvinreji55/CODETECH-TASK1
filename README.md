###Project: Student Grade Tracker (Python Programming)


###Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Python-based Student Grade Tracker that allows for efficient management and 
analysis of student grades. The application will provide functionalities to add, update, and track student grades, 
while generating statistical summaries and insights to monitor academic performance.

### Key Activities:

### 1. Data Input: Develop a system for entering and storing student names, subjects, and corresponding grades.
### 2. Grade Calculation: Implement functions to calculate overall performance, including averages, highest and lowest grades.
### 3. Data Update: Allow users to update student grades and information as needed.
### 4. Performance Summary: Generate reports with statistical insights such as class averages, grade distributions, and student rankings.
### 5. Visualization: Create simple plots using Matplotlib to visualize grade distributions, trends, and comparisons.

### Technologies Used:
### 1. Python: The core programming language for building the application.
### 2. pandas: Used for storing and managing student grade data in a structured format.
### 3. Matplotlib: To visualize student performance and grade distributions through charts.
